<h3>Starting Moves</h3>
<b>Deity</b> Give your god a name and choose your deity’s domain:<ul><li>Healing and Restoration</li><li>Bloody Conquest</li><li>Civilization</li><li>Knowledge and Hidden Things</li><li>The Downtrodden and Forgotten</li><li>What Lies Beneath</li></ul>Choose one precept of your religion:<ul><li>It preaches the sanctity of suffering, add Petition: Suffering</li><li>It’s clutish and insular, add Petition: Gaining Secrets</li><li>It Observes important sacrificial rites, add Petition: Offering</li><li>It believes in trial by combat, add Petition: Personal Victory</li></ul>
<b>Divine Guidance</b> Petition your deity according to the precept of your religion: you are granted some useful knowledge or boon related to your deity’s domain. The GM will tell you what.
<b>Cast A Spell</b> Unleash a spell granted by your deity (roll+WIS): 10+ the the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again. 7-9 the spell is cast, but choose one:<ul><li>You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot.</li><li>Your casting distances you from your deity; take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you commune.</li><li>After it is cast, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.</li></ul>
<b>Commune</b> Uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet contemplation:<ul><li>Lose any spells already granted to you</li><li>Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed your own level +1, and none of which is a higher level than your own level</li><li>Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit</li></ul>
<b>Turn Undead</b> Hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for protection (roll+WIS): 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal.
